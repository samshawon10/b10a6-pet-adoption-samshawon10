# Pet Adopt Shop

## Project Description
Pet Adopt Shop is a fully responsive web application that allows users to browse, sort, like, and adopt pets. The platform dynamically fetches pet data from an API and provides an intuitive user experience.

## Key Features
1. **Responsive Navbar** - Fully responsive navigation bar that collapses into a mobile menu on smaller screens.
2. **Dynamic Pet Listings** - Fetch and display pets dynamically with categories and sorting by price.
3. **Like & Adopt Functionality** - Users can like pets and adopt them with a countdown animation.
4. **Detailed Pet View** - Clicking on the "Details" button opens a modal displaying full pet details.
5. **Loading Spinner & Error Handling** - Shows a loading spinner when fetching data and handles missing API values gracefully.

## ES6 Features Used
- **Arrow Functions** for cleaner syntax.
- **Template Literals** for dynamic content rendering.
- **Destructuring Assignment** to extract data efficiently.
- **Spread Operator** for handling and merging state updates.
- **Async/Await** for fetching API data asynchronously.
